A construction pit represents an early stage of building—usually concealed by a fence and quickly erased by the structure that rises above it. In this case, the construction was frozen, exposing the “fetus of a building” to natural processes for an extended period of time. As a result, a unique, surreal aesthetic emerged, shaped by elements such as construction spikes, square columns, pools of water, and metal surfaces, all visibly altered by nature.
As a small intervention and a parallel branch of development, I photographed the site and placed the prints within the central area of the pit, directly onto the bare, uncovered concrete walls, which appeared to function as an ideal exhibition space.
After a year, the prints had begun to disintegrate against the walls, leaving only faint traces behind. Whether the construction eventually becomes a building or remains unfinished, it will, over time, inevitably turn into a ruin and—much like my photographic intervention—fade back into nature’s uniformity.
