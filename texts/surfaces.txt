Surfaces (2019–ongoing) explores the interplay between human intervention and nature's continuous processes within natural systems.
Human activity acts as an opposing stream, varying in scale and significance, while nature increases entropy.
This dynamic creates a tension between order and chaos that becomes visible on the surfaces of our surroundings.
Paradoxically, from an anthropocentric perspective, nature appears to tend toward chaos, while it is often human intervention that produces it.
When observed from a sufficient distance, and across a long enough temporal scale, human actions become small and ultimately insignificant.
The photographs were taken primarily at anonymous locations—non-places containing transitional or in-between objects.
They were made with an ephemeral mindset, in which a hundred-year-old abandoned ruin does not differ fundamentally from a newly built house: both are future ruins.
The work operates through varying degrees of subtlety, attempting to observe and articulate the world as a still—or provisional—state within a process that extends far beyond human comprehension.
